C++ BANKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - README  
───────────────────────────────────────────────────  

📌 DESCRIPTION:  
My very first project knowing that i haven't learned OOP yet, A procedural console application for managing bank clients, users, and transactions. Uses structs and file I/O for data storage.  

🔑 KEY FEATURES:  
- Login system with role-based permissions  
- Add/delete/update/search clients (account, PIN, balance)  
- Deposit/withdraw funds + total balance view  
- User management (create/delete roles)  
- Data saved to `ClientsRecord.txt` and `Users.txt`  

⚙️ HOW TO USE:  
1. Compile with a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o bank`)  
2. Run executable (`./bank` on Linux/Mac, `bank.exe` on Windows)  
3. Default admin credentials (add via Users.txt):  
   Username: Admin / Password: 1234  

⚠️ NOTES:  
- No classes used—built with structs and modular functions  
- Files auto-create if missing (ensure write permissions)  
- Tested on Windows/Linux with GCC/Clang  

📂 DEPENDENCIES:  
- Standard C++ Libraries  
- C++17 compatible compiler  

📌 NEXT STEP :
- Learn OOP and refactor it!
